The thirty crow tried hard to put his beak inside the pot but could not \\nreach the water. \\nThe water in the pot was very low. He tried to move the pot but it was heavy. He could not \\neven tilt the pot alone. The crow began thinking of ways to get water from the pot. \\nWhen he looked around, he saw few stones lying on the ground suddenly he had an idea. \\nHe started picking up stones in his beak one by one and dropped them in the pot.\\n\\nAs the stones went down the pot, the water level started to rise. \\nNow the crow was able to drink water. \\nHe drank the water happily and flew back to his tree. \\nMoral Of the Story: Where there's is a Will, there's is a Way. There's always a way - if you're \\ncommitted. - Tony Robbins\\nQuestion: What is the crow looking for?\\n\\nOnly return the helpful answer below and nothing else.\\nHelpful answer:\\nThe crow is looking for water.\\n\\n\""
